# Bioinformatics-Secondary-Structure-Prediction-
GOR3 algorithm implementation using Python (Pandas) <br>
Please note that it is not an efficient implementation to predict secondary structures, but so informative.
If you know the theory (see "Summary.pdf" file), you can easily follow the code and understand how to implement GOR3
